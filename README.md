# Quick start

This repo contains the R source code of our paper:

A novel Bayesian hierarchical mixed-effects weighted Poisson regression model to explain socio-demographic factors associated with fertility rate in Afghanistan

The R source code is `main.Rmd`. The previous simulation results are saved under `data_output` folder. By default, running the `main.Rmd` won't rerun the simulation again. So, simply knitting a pdf file will generate all the plots required for the paper.

The source of the UNICEF dataset is stored in `data_src` folder.

The supplementary file is [here](supplementary.pdf).
